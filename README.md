# Resize Search
 Adds a feature that allows you to drag the side of the search box to resize it, similarly to the emote/gif/sticker selector.

 ## Installation
 - Open a terminal
 - Paste this `cd %userprofile%\Astra\pluginsAstra && git clone https://github.com/SpoonMcForky/resize-search`
 - Enable the plugin within Discord

 ### Warning!
 This is still very much a WIP, when Discord changes classes this will break for some amount of time.
